INFO <60001136> - Iteration 5_1 failed because some connections were not able to be routed.
ERROR <60001150> - No iteration could yield a fully routed design.
Please check the Place and Route reports (.par) for the individual iterations under the directory "C:\Users\jbowman\Desktop\microP_lab2\fpga\radiant_project\lab2_jb\impl_1\microP_lab2_impl_1_par.dir\" and review your device utilization and timing constraints.
